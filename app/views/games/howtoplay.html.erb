<h1>How To Play Setsolver</h1>
Setsolver is a Facebook interactive version of the SET&dagger; card game, where the object of the
game is to find "sets" of three cards with matching characteristics.  Each card has four characteristics:
<ul>
<li><strong>number</strong>: the number of shapes on the card.  Every card will have 
    <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, or <strong>3</strong> shapes, and multiple shapes will 
    always be identical to one another.</li>
<li><strong>shape</strong>: the type of shape displayed on the card.  These shapes will always be
    either <strong>oval</strong>, <strong>diamond</strong>, or <strong>squiggle</strong>.
<li><strong>color</strong>: the color of the shapes (<strong>red</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, 
    or <strong>purple</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>shading</strong>: how darkly shaded are the shapes? Shapes can be either 
    <strong>outlined</strong>, <strong>filled</strong> solid, or <strong>shaded</strong> with line patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about normal playing cards -- they have two characteristics (number and suit) and the cards
themselves are made up of every combination of number and suit.  A deck of SET cards similarly has
every combination of the four characteristics above, for a result of 3x3x3x3 (or 81) cards.  Here are a
few examples: </p>

<h2>Finding a Set</h2>

<p>Now that you are familiar with the cards, we move on to the object of the game: finding three-card
sets. A collection of three cards is considered a set if <strong>all four of their characteristics are 
either all alike or all different</strong>.   Three purple cards would count as "all alike" in its
color characteristic, and if these cards were one red, one green, and one purple this would count as
"all different".  If all three other characteristics (number, shading, and shape) fit this patterns
then you have a Set.  If one characteristic fails in being all different or all the same (such as
two purples and a green) then you don't have a Set, regardless of the other three characteristics.</p>

<h2>Examples of Sets</h2>

<h3>Here are some examples of three-card combinations that are Sets:</h3>

<p><%= render_threecard_set_from_cardface_ids(4,31,58) %>: This is a Set because the colors are
all green, the shadings are all filled, the shapes are all diamonds, but the numbers are all
different (1 diamond, 2 diamond, and 3 diamonds).  Sets like this with three common 
characteristics are the easiest to find.</p>

<p><%= render_threecard_set_from_cardface_ids(12,13,17) %>: This is a Set because the colors are
all red, only one shape exists in each card, and yet the shadings and shapes are all different
for each card.</p>

<p><%= render_threecard_set_from_cardface_ids(2,40,81) %>: This Set is hard to identify because no
characteristics are alike in any of the cards, but nevertheless it is a Set.  If no obvious Sets
can be found at first, there's a good chance that a three-card Set exists with different colors,
different numbers, different shapes, and different shadings.</p>

<h3>...and here are some three-card examples of non-Sets:</h3>

<p><%= render_threecard_set_from_cardface_ids(4,32,58) %>: This may look like a Set at first glance
because of the similarity to the first example above.  However, the shapes are not all same or all
different (diamond, squiggle, diamond), and as such this is not a Set.</p>

<p><%= render_threecard_set_from_cardface_ids(65,60,73) %>: Another deceptive non-Set: the numbers
and colors match up, but the shadings do not. (2 shaded, 1 filled).</p>
