SetsolverMulti
--------------

I've already created a single-player Set game Facebook application using the
Facebooker library -- now it's time for me to create the multi-player game 
I always wanted to create with Facebooker2.

If you wish to run this app locally, all you need to do is create a new 
config/facebooker.yml file and add the following:

development:
  app_id: <facebook_app_id>
  secret: <facebook_secret_key>

(same for production and test)

Further information on this and everything else about Facebooker2 can be
found at http://github.com/mmangino/facebooker2/.
